## Installation

The OTF or TTF folders contain the font files used by most user operating systems.

If you are running Rocky Linux 8, or any similar derivatives, you can install the fonts with the following:
```
sudo yum install rocky-display-fonts rocky-text-fonts
```
Note that Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS users will need to [enable Fedora EPEL first](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL).
