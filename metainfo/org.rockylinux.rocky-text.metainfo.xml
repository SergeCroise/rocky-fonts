  <summary>Rocky Text font family</summary>
  <description>
    <p>Rocky is a fresh take on the geometric sans genre,
       taking inspiration from a range of American sans serifs
       including Tempo and Highway Gothic.
    </p>
    <p>The Text styles have a slightly smaller x-height and narrower width
       for better legibility, are spaced more generously, and have thinned joins
       for better performance at small sizes.
    </p>
    <p>The fonts were originally commissioned by Paula Scher / Pentagram
       and designed by Jeremy Mickel / MCKL for the new Rocky identity.
